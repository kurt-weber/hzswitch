# Install
1)Click on the green button "Code"


2)Click on "Download Zip"


3)Extract the directory "hzswitch-master" from the zip file


4)Simply copy the entire directory to the Rhythmbox plugins directory.

For a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins

The full path would look something like:
/home/username/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/

If there is no plugins directory you have to create it


5)Start Rhythmbox


6)In Rhythmbox click on "Tools"->"Plugins"


7)Activate Hz Switch by checking the box next to it.

Two new buttons will appear. 

With the first button you can choose between 4 operating modes.

~Mode 1: Converting A4=440Hz to 432Hz

~Mode 2: Converting A4=440Hz to 421.6Hz (Mozart's A4)

~Mode 3: Converting C3=128 (Rudolf Steiner frequency)

~Mode 4: Converting A4=432Hz to 440Hz

With the Hz-Switch button you can enable/disable the convertion.


8)HAVE FUN!
